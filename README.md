# 🧠 ML Learning Lab

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
To progressively build my skills in data science, from Python fundamentals to deploying interactive machine learning applications.

---

## 📂 Subfolders
- `streamlit-101/` → Dashboards and mini-apps built with Streamlit 
- `llm-fundamentals/` → From text processing and embeddings to RAG systems  

---

## 🧩 Note
This repository is **not** a showcase of polished projects yet, it is a **learning environment** for exploration, experimentation, and step-by-step improvement.

I aim to keep everything **organized** and **professional**, as I am currently preparing for a **Machine Learning / Data Science internship**.
